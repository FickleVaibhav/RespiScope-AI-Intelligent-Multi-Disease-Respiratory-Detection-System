# RespiScope-AI-Intelligent-Multi-Disease-Respiratory-Detection-System
RespiScope-AI is an advanced AI-powered diagnostic system that detects multiple respiratory diseases — such as asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, COPD, and healthy lung conditions — using cough and breathing sounds captured through a smart digital stethoscope or built-in microphone.
## Overview
RespiScope-AI is an advanced **AI-powered diagnostic system** that detects multiple respiratory diseases such as **Asthma, Bronchitis, COPD, Pneumonia, and Healthy lung conditions** using cough and breathing sounds.  
The system combines **hardware (digital stethoscope + ESP32)** with **deep learning** to provide accurate multi-class classification.

Users can record audio via:
- A **smart stethoscope** (ESP32 + high-sensitivity microphone)  
- Or **web / mobile interface** with built-in microphone  

The audio is preprocessed, features are extracted using **YAMNet or Mel-Spectrograms**, and classified by a **CNN or Transformer model** trained on medical-grade datasets (ICBHI 2017, Coswara, etc.).
